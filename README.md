**Hot Range** is a customizable forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes a unique envelope-like indicator to identify potential trading opportunities in the market.

## Features
- Customizable parameters: Users have the option to customize the period and deviation of the indicator for each currency pair, allowing for personalized trading strategies.
- Automatic trading: The software performs trading operations based on the indicator values, placing buy or sell orders when the price crosses above or below the upper or lower envelope, respectively.
- Risk management: The software calculates the stop loss and take profit levels for each trade based on predefined risk management rules.
- Magic number generation: Each trade is assigned a unique magic number for easy identification and tracking.

## How It Works
The Hot Range software calculates the upper and lower envelope values for each bar in the specified period. It then checks if the current close price crosses above or below the respective envelope, indicating potential trading opportunities.

If the close price crosses above the upper envelope, a buy order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function. If the close price crosses below the lower envelope, a sell order is placed. The `StopLossLevel()` and `TakeProfitLevel()` functions calculate the appropriate levels for risk management.

The software also allows for customization of parameters for each currency pair. The `CustomizeParameters()` function retrieves a list of currency pairs and sets custom deviation and period values for each pair. Users can implement their own logic to retrieve these values from a database or file.

## Usage
To use the Hot Range software, follow these steps:
1. Set the desired input parameters, such as the period and deviation, in the code.
2. Enable or disable customization of parameters using the `enableCustomization` input parameter.
3. Compile and run the code in a MetaTrader platform.
4. Monitor the trading operations and results.
